✨ Why This Redesign?

temporary email tools are super handy, but most of them feel outdated or clunky. So this project is to improve existing website :

- 🧭 Make the UI easier to navigate with fewer clicks
- 🎯 Solve pain points like cluttered layouts and unclear actions
- 🧑‍🦯 Bring in accessibility and better readability for everyone
